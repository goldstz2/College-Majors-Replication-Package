# Interceptions-Wins-Final-Project
This is my Final Project for STA145, I analyzed the relationship that interceptions have with wins and used the Philadelphia eagles as the observed team, both interceptions thrown and caught were accounted for.

## **Instructions**


## **Data**
The data collected for this project were the interceptions recorded for the Philidelphia Eagles from the 2015 to 2018 season, The main goal was to figure out if there is a correlation between interceptions recorded and wins. I analyzed each game for each season on EPSN and Pro Football Reference.

## **Operationalization**
Team success was being operationalized and to do this, I created a win/loss variable for each game, a value of 1 equals a win and 0 equals a loss, This allowed team success to be represented in simple terms whilst being able to compare it to other games in the dataset.

Interceptions thrown were operationalized through observing the number of turnovers the Eagles quarterback through each game via Pro Football Reference, Interceptions thrown reached a height of 3 and minimum of 0.

Interceptions caught were operationalized through observing the number of turnovers the Eagles defense were able to turnover the ball by an interception, Interceptions caught peaked at a height of 3 and a minimum of 0.
